# LED-Nameplate
This LED nameplate is a little birthday gift I made for a friend using WS2812s left over from the [Midi Mosaic](https://github.com/mclemcrew/midi-mosaic-teensy)

## Getting Started

Due to the nature of this project, the code isn't necessarily transferrable to other domains unless you built an LED nameplate as well (and if you've built a similar project I would love to see what you created! :smile: )

## Built With

* [Arduino Nano] - The microcontroller used
* [WS2812B RGB 5050 LED Strip] – LED strips inside the nameplate
* [SparkFun Touch Potentiometer] – Used to change the color of the lights while turned on
